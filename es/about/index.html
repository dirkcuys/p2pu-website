			<h2 class="text-center">What We’re All About</h2>

			Peer 2 Peer University (we mostly just say P2PU) is a grassroots open education project that
			organizes learning outside of institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their
			achievements. P2PU creates a model for lifelong learning alongside traditional formal higher
			education. Leveraging the internet and educational materials openly available online, P2PU
			enables high-quality low-cost education opportunities.

			<h2 class="text-center">Our values</h2>

			Three things guide everything we do: <i>openness, community and peer learning</i>.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>P2PU is open</strong>Being open enables more people to participate and innovate,
					and makes us accountable. Our community is open so that everyone can participate. Our
					content is open so that everyone can use it. Our model & technology are open so others can
					experiment with it and we can all improve it together. Our processes are open so that we
					remain accountable to our purpose and community.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>P2PU is a community</strong>P2PU is community-centered and our governance model
					reflects that. P2PU is built driven by volunteers, who are involved in all aspects of the
					project. As members of this community, we speak and act with civility. We show tolerance
					and respect for other opinions, people, and perspectives. We strive for quality as a
					process – driven by community-review, feedback and revision.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>P2PU is peer learning</strong>P2PU is teaching and learning by peers for peers.
					Everyone has something to contribute and everyone has something to learn. We are all
					teachers & learners. We take responsibility for our own and each others’ learning.
				</li>
