	<h2>How We Learn...</h2>

	<p>
		One of our core values is “peer learning.” It’s kind of a wonky term, but we’ve grown to love
		it. Generally we use it as a shorthand for the following framework for learning:
	</p>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="col-md-4 ">
			<h2>Expertise <i class="fa fa-star fa-2x pull-right"></i></h2>
			<h4>everyone has it:</h4>

			<p>
				in the average P2PU learning group, you might have a super-organized project manager, a
				whip-smart headline writer, a shark of a negotiator and an exhibition designer. No matter
				what the subject of the course, everyone brings their suite of skills and experiences to the
				team. In this light “expertise” doesn’t necessarily mean a skill that is recognized by a
				degree or a job title, but instead refers to a more informal definition of talent. What is
				the ability to bake a cake, anyway, if not an arena of expertise?
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Sharing <i class="fa fa-share-alt fa-flip-horizontal fa-2x pull-right"></i></h2>
			<h4>and connecting is how we learn:</h4>

			<p>
				every single P2PU experience will ask you to work on something together and share it.
				Whether it’s a team-based project such as the <a
					href="http://info.p2pu.org/2013/04/29/at-the-cockpit-how-the-data-explorer-mission-works/">
				Data Explorer </a>, a peer review team such as <a
					href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/111/copyright-4-educators-aus/">Copyright 4
				Educators</a>, or making an HTML file with the <a
					href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/">School of Webcraft</a>, interacting
				with others, sharing your work and imparting your knowledge is part-and-parcel of the
				learning experience.
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Feedback <i class="fa fa-volume-up fa-flip-horizontal fa-2x pull-right"></i></h2>
			<h4>is necessary in order to improve:</h4>

			<p>
				at P2PU, we believe that delivering feedback is a kind of learning. We built our friendly
				assessment platform <a href="http://badges.p2pu.org">Badges</a> around that very principle.
				When you submit a project, another P2PU community member will give you feedback to help
				extend your learning.
			</p>

			<p>
				The feedback helps you by honing on your individual needs, and helps the P2PU member learn
				more by diagnosing where you’re at with the project.
			</p>

	</div>
	<p>
		Those are the core elements of what you can expect from every peer learning experience, and they
		can take many forms.
